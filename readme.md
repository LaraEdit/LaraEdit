## About LaraEdit
The goal behind LaraEdit is to provide a development environment that can be accessed from the web to allow developers to work from anywhere, using any device (that has internet access and a modern web browser). Beyond that, LaraEdit should NOT force it's users to adhere to any coding standards and allow them to work/develop as they normally would, just in a more productive manner.

If this sounds like it may be too good to be true, stick around and watch this magic happen. If your wondering what such a package would even be good for, move along. If you are curious, [ask your questions in the issues](https://github.com/laraedit/laraedit/issues)
